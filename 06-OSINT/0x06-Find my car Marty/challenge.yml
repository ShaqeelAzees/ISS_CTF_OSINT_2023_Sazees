Help me Marty!

My DeLorean has been stolen! I parked it when I went to grab a drink with a friend and when I came out it was gone. I cannot believe this. The scummy thief even had the audicity to send me a gloating picture of him with my car. Maybe I can get some information from this picture though?

Use this picture and help me find my car Marty.
